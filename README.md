# DeepWindow
There is a window aperture at Lapinlahden sairaala (Lapinlahti hospital) in Helsinki.
On the hallway side it has glasses, but the other side is closed with plasterboard.

I installed in there 3x56 pixels of LDP8806 RGB LED strip and an ESP8266 to control the lights.

Read the source to see what it does.
